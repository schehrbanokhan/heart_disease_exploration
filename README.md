# Heart Disease
The Data set I used to conduct an exploratory dana analysis was taken from Kaggle. this data was published by UC Irvine in collabration with researchers from Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach,CA.
I spent some time taking a look at the data set and understanding what each column represented. Some of the columns were then dropped as there was inadequate information as to what they were being used for in this data set. This was a quick analysis and I primarily used histograms for visualization.

## Observations:
Most peopl suffering heart attacks are between the age of 50 and 60. The mean age of a person who got a heart attack was 54.4.

Men suffer from heart attacks significantly more often than women. In fact the percentage of men suffering from a heart attack in this dataset was calulcated to be 68% while the percentage of women suffering from a heart attack was seen to be 32%.

Most of the people who got a heart attack suffered from level 0 chest pains prior to the attack.

Resting blood pressure most frequently seen in patients prior to admission lies between 120 and 140. The mean resting blood pressure was 131.6.

A healthy cholestrol level in most humans is less than 200. From this graph we learn that people with heart disease have a significantly higher cholestrol than average humans. The mean cholestrol level in this data set is 246.3. The lowest cholestrol level was 126 while the highest was seen to be 564. Since there is only a single case of the max cholestrol, it may be an anomoly.

Most of the people in this data set had a fasting blood sugar level less than 120mg/dL

The maximum heart rate acheived for most patients was about 160, with the average being 150.
